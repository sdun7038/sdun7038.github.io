        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p> My name is Sabirah Duncan and I currently attend Thomas A. Edison CTE High School. My shop of three years developed my skills in Web Design and App Development. I've learned about Web application development and the creation of application programs that reside on remote servers and are delivered to the user's device over the Internet. A web application (web app) does not need to be downloaded and is instead accessed through a network.</p>
